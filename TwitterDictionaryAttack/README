This program is a bruteforcer which means it is capable of getting the password of any Twitter account in time.
It is NOT to be used to obtain the password of any Twitter account that you do not have permission to obtain. 
That is illegal.

This program itself is not illegal. Do NOT use it illegally.

PLEASE INCLUDE THIS README WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS OF THIS PROGRAM!!! 

Thank you :)
